Mini-homework:

1. Prepare a list of user stories
that describe the user-point-of-view
functionality of your project.

Every project must have 5-10 of these.

2. Step two.
Break down each of these "stories"
into technical list of steps.
Small user stories do not need to be broken down.

!!!! Either use Trello.com or create a text file for teacher to discuss tomorrow. !!!!

?
Size of task: minimum 30 minutes, maximum half a day.

Example:

1. User story: I want to be able to login

2. Steps break down for developer:
* Add table for user accounts 'user', with
information if user is administrator or regular user.
* Create a custom dialog and add logic
to verify username and password.
* Show it before we display the
main window of the program.
