1. Make sure you've done Scrum with your project partner.
If not - do it now, and save it in 'dailyscrum.txt'
and push it to GitHub repository.

2. In your repository create file 'stories.txt' and paste
there all user stories and their breakdowns
into steps that you craeted yesterday.

If you don't have them - discuss user stories with your partner,
write them down, break them down into steps and save in 'stories.txt' file.

You should have 3-10 user stories and at least 15 steps.

Each step must be at least 30 minutes long, at most 4 hours long.
If you have all steps in Trello you can skip text file creation.
Push the file to GitHub.

3. Register an account in Trello.com, add your partner
to it, make the board Public (read only for anyone)
Add 4 lists: "Backlog" "In progress" "In testing" "Done"

4. On the forum in thread 'Post your GitHub & Trello URLs here'
reply to the thread and post four lines:
- your name and your partner
- project title
- URL to Trello board
- URL to GitHub repository
