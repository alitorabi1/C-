TASK - create project EnumsFromFile

Using Notepad in bin/Debug create file
coffee.txt with the following content.

Sugar

In your source code define the following enum
enum CoffeeOption {
	None, Sugar, Milk, Cream, Decaf, Splenda }

In Main() define

Your job is to read the file, parse enums and add them to 'options' list, then print them out using foreach loop.

If you encounter an invalid line in the file - display
a warning, e.g. "Unknown value Ash", ignore it an continue.

Using Notepad in bin/Debug create 'travels.txt' file with
a list of visited continents, possibly repeated, similar to:

Using the [Flags] annotation read in the data from file
into variable in Main() defined as:
