2. Read all 5 pages on Common Interface Controls (menus, status bar, ribbon, etc.)

http://www.wpf-tutorial.com/common-interface-controls/menu-control/

 

3. Improve your existing "Notepad" project by making the following modifications:

- use DockPanel to position elements

- at the bottom add Status Bar Control, similar to one described in http://www.wpf-tutorial.com/common-interface-controls/statusbar-control/

- make status bar show full path to a file currently opened (or that it is a new file), as well as information whether the content has been modified.

- to the Menu add items File->New, File->Save

If a file is currently open and was modified and not saved selecting File->New must show a warning dialog asking user to abondon changes without savings [YesCancel].

Same for File->Close(), if content has been modified and not saved.

Same for File->Exit, if content has been modified and not saved.

Same if user attempts to close the window by pressing [X] on window frame, and content has been modified and not saved.

If no file is currently open then File->Close and File->Save options of the menu must be grayed out / Disabled.

In other words - make it behave just like Notepad from MS Windows.
