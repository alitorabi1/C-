TASK

Create project ReadWriteText.

Ask the user which operation he/she wants to perform,
reading or writing.

If reading:
- Ask user for a name of file.
- Read ALL the contents of the file and display it.

If writing:
- Ask user for a name of file.
- Ask user for a line of text.
- Write the line of text to file.

Notes:
- Make sure the file is closed after the operation.
- Make sure you handle the IO exceptions that may occur.
- There is no loop here, only one operation per execution

Example sessions:

What do you want to do? 1-reading, 2-writing: 1
Enter name of file to read: data.txt
File not found.

What do you want to do? 1-reading, 2-writing: 1
Enter name of file to read: text.txt
Contents is:
Hello
This is the
contents of this file

What do you want to do? 1-reading, 2-writing: 2
Enter name of file to write: output.txt
Enter a line of text:
Hi everyone, this is a line of text.
Your text has been saved in output.txt


TASK - HOMEWORK 1 - project FileNumbers

After you create the project run program once
to create 'bin\Debug' sub-directory in the project directory.

Using Notepad create a text file 'input.txt'
with floating point numbers. Put it in 'bin\Debug' directory.

2.33
7.0
AAAAFDFSF
6
7.88

In your program open the file, read in each
of the numbers into List<double>.

Then compute and display:
- the sum
- the average
- the median value
- all values below the median

Write the largest value to file 'output.txt'

Notes:
- handle IO exceptions if necessary
- if parsing problems occur - display a warning and
continue to the next line


TASK - HOMEWORK 2

Create project CommonNumbers.

Declare two int[] arrays called intsOne and intsTwo
and assign a list of unique integers to each of them, e.g.
int[] intsOne = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
int[] intsTwo = {3, 6, 7, 9, 1, 2}

Write code to:

a) display the list of intsOne in one line, comma-separated
b) display the list of intsTwo in one line, comma-separated
c) find which integers exist in both lists and display them
one per line.

Note: do not use array sorting or other utility methods
from standard C# library.

Example output:
intsOne: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
intsTwo: 3, 6, 7, 9, 1, 2,
common: 1, 3, 7, 9,
