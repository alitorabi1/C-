Quiz 1 - DotNet Fundamentals

Create project Quiz1Results. Run it once.
Using Notepad, in bin/Debug directory create
file 'sprints.txt' with content similar to this one
which will contain times in seconds of 60 meter
sprints by different runners.

Example 'sprints.txt' file.

Jerry
8.7
9.2
9.9
Tom
12.12
Larisa
9.1
8.88

Analyze the contents of the file and find out the
following information:

* What is the average time of all runs of all runners?
* What is the fastest time of all runs?
* How many times has each runner run?
* What is the average run time of each runner?
* How many runners were there?

Example output:
Average run time for all runners was  
The fastest ran was 8.7
Jerry ran 3 time(s)
Tom ran 1 time(s)
Larisa ran 2 time(s)
Jerry's average is 9.27
Tom's average is 12.12
Larisa's average is 8.99
There were 3 runners in total.

Make sure you handle the usual expected exceptions.

Do not use array embedded functions to compute averages, sums or to sort.

Suggestion: try not to store information
in any complicated data structure.
Instead - use many for loops to obtain the necessary data.
